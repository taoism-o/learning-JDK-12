**Tip Bellow**

This repository is created for myself-studied note at the beginning.
So that the tests or some articles/paragraphs may write down by Chinese, 
which is just for convenience and more helps for my pool memory.
If there is more time, or more people may join in the future, 
you could be able to see the documents for other language versions.
